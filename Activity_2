# Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge
class Vehicle:
    def move(self):
        pass  # Placeholder method to be overridden

class Car(Vehicle):
    def move(self):
        print("🚗 Driving on the road")

class Plane(Vehicle):
    def move(self):
        print("✈️ Flying in the sky")

class Boat(Vehicle):
    def move(self):
        print("🚢 Sailing on water")

# Using polymorphism
vehicles = [Car(), Plane(), Boat()]
for v in vehicles:
    v.move()
